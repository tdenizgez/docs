# Orkes Conductor - Documentation

This site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. If you need help
with editing this site, you should be able to refer to the Docusaurus docs for help. Alternatively, look us up on Slack.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.

### Deployment

Raise a PR to our main branch. Once we merge, our CI/CD will deploy the site for you. Thanks for contributing!
